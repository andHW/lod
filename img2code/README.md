# Image to Code

This directory contains the script to generate the weaving code that weaves the input image.

## Usage

```bash
python3 img2code.py <imagePath>
```

## Limitations

- The script can only handle jpg.
- The script can only handle square images.
- If the image is too big, the result could barely be recognizable
- The generated weaving code is non-minimal.
