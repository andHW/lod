# Loom of Doom

Loom of Doom is an HTML5/JavaScript weaving machine that weaves pixel arts.

Since this machine is an abstract simulation of a Jacquard Loom, it is intended
to be complicated and pointlessly tricky, but you could still find some
techniques to make the pixel art creation process less painful.

I think of this project as a game, but you could also consider it an
almost-useless machine 🫠.

## Background

This is a project for [Literature in the Age of Artificial Intelligence (LIT-AI), Spring 2022](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2021/4995-fall/index.html) 
at [Columbia University](http://columbia.edu/).

The brilliant class cannot happen without them!

THANK YOU!!!

### Other web projects

This project is of course, inspired by [r/place on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) as well.
The color palette originates from the r/place.

### A Jojo Reference

This project is also inspired by Araki's artworks.

- Chapter 101, Volume 12, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 6 Jolyne Cujoh: Stone Ocean (ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 第6部 空条徐倫 ―『石作りの海ストーンオーシャン』)

## Technical Details

The web-based weaving machine is written in vanilla JS.

The imageCode generator is written in Python.

### Limitations

- The web app is only partially responsive.
- It doesn't really "recreate" parts and actual mechanism in the Jacquard Loom
- No physical components are designed, so the experience is non-physical
- The board is small. Although it is scalable, the interaction for a bigger board has to be redesigned. Such as auto-zooming.
- There are still many features that could be implemented.

## Advice for my CS fellows who are taking this class in the future:

You've made a brilliant choice! I took this class together with NLP in the same
semester. It was super fun to learn the historical and technical aspects of NLP
simultaneously. I got A+ in both classes while taking DS1, being a TA for the UI
class, and finding a job at the same time, so doing them together is definitely
doable, enjoyable, and, at the same time, rewarding in terms of the knowledge
and the grade (if that's what you only care)!

Another note is maybe you could extend, criticize, or reinvent my project if
you're also interested in the Jacquard Loom and web development at the same time
(PLEASE CONSULT THE TA/PROF BEFORE YOU DO THIS).

Don't expect my code is very neat, though. I've only spent 48 hours on the coding part.

Hopefully, this piece of advice is not misleading or entirely useless.
Peace.
